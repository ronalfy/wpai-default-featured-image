# WP All Import Default Featured Image

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ronalfy/wpai-default-featured-image.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ronalfy/wpai-default-featured-image)

Allows integration with WooCommerce's default fallback image and uses that if no featured image is found after a post save in WP All Import.

Post image in WooCommerce must be an ID (number) by going to WooCommerce->Settings->Products. Make sure the ID is for an attachment image.
